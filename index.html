        <div class="subheading mb-5">Economics and Business AdministrationðŸ“šðŸ“ˆ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Iâ€™m a third year Economics and Business Administration major in the University of California Riverside. I seek a focus on Human Resources and Finance. Iâ€™m the first in my family to attend college and aspire to graduate by next year, 2021. I am the daughter of immigrants who have raised me to be a hard worker and earn my place in the world. Itâ€™s very difficult to get me to give up, I will continue to try to solve the problems whether that be within coworker conflicts or analytics and finances. I have done leadership programs on campus and management. Such as how to understand and deal with different type of dynamics and personalities at work. It is important to understand and hear both sides of the story when employees have a conflict and approach the issue without any bias. The Interpersonal Relationship Seminar taught the following skills: assertiveness, conflict management, listening, self-disclosure, and understanding personality styles and group dynamics. <br><br>

        I currently work as a Multimedia Support Operator on for the Information Technology Solutions department on campus.  This job requires me to be open to any issue that a client has and fix it as quickly as possible in an efficient manner. There is constant communication and teamwork with coworkers and supervisors. I operate in a small office where I answer phone calls and take note of the calls received. I monitor any pending equipment deliveries and inform operators of set times to deliver it. Assist with set-up and pick-up of equipment for classrooms and events. Conduct and monitor video recordings for presenters and events around campus to ensure the video was done correctly. Lastly, I lock and unlock classrooms and set them up for the students and professors to function throughout the day.I have gained experience with customer relations and discuss methods to improve service for customers and employees.<br><br>

        I worked as a Student Clerk for the Election of 2018. This job required working with over 200 voters coming in to vote and organizing the process in a quick and efficient manner. It required distributing ballots, answering questions and concerns, greet and register the voters. It was a fast-paced environment and I had to adapt to help out the voters in an effective way. We worked as a team and at the end of the day we closed and counted all the ballots. This experience taught me how to manage large amounts of people in a timely manner.<br><br>

        I will specialize in Human Resources to further understand the workspace in the business while networking with employees and using this information to help administrate different policies within the company. I seek to cater to the employees and help them feel welcomed at their jobs. I want to make the employees feel safe and have a high morale for work. I also will have an organizational schedule for different sections of work. I also seek to be involved in the financial aspect of human resources to maximize the companyâ€™s profits.<br><br>
